        <h1>Using Saltruta</h1>
        <pre>
            <code>
There is currently no main server for saltruta, although this will change in the future (most likely with v2.0).

The bot does not currently support "/" commands, and there is no plan for this to be implemented in the near future.

The official prefix for saltruta is "w!", however, the "!" can be ommited altogether.

<h2>Features:</h2>
<h3>Expeditions</h3>
Expeditions are the way to earn cash/bags/coins.

Users can send their banks on an expedition to collect different amounts of different currencies.

Only 1 expedition can be performed by a user at a time.

There are currently 5 different expeditions:
 1. Bank Hiest (5 cash, takes 12 hours)
 2. Treasure Hunt (2 coins, takes 12 hours)
 3. 9-5 Office Job (1 bag, takes 8 hours)
 4. Dragon Slayer (10 cash, takes 24 hours)
 5. Farming Expedition (2 bags, 16 hours)

The amounts and times can be decreased by using boosts (see w!shop)
Amounts are also increased by the value of a user bank.

To calculate the multiplier of a user:
1+(0.05*a)+(l/100)
where a = amount of cards in user's bank
and l = sum of all the levels in a user's bank

If a user had 5 level 10 cards, then they would have a multiplier of:
1+(0.05*5)+(50/100)
=1.75x multiplier


<h3>Daily Rewards</h3>
Not currently in v2.0


<h3>Equipment</h3>
Not currently in v2.0


<h3>Card Drops</h3>
Card Drops are how users gain cards.

Every minute, a check is ran to see if a server is eligible for a drop.

To be eligible for a drop the server must:
 - Have a registered channel (see w!setup)
 - Have over 100 messages since the last drop

When a card is dropped, checks are run for things like wishlists.

Once a user has clicked the "grab" button, a three second countdown begins.
Every user that also clicks within those three seconds is enterd.
A winner is randomly chosen after the three second timer for who is to get the card.
